Hi! This project grows from my attempt to setup awesome.

INSTALL
=======

0. Config set uses lots of third-party programs. Here is some of them:

* rfkill
* inotail
* sensors
* iwevent
* inotifywait
* pkill
* acpitool
* notify-send
* xkb-switch (see http://github.com/ierton/xkb-switch)
* Search for "Environment programs" in rc.lua for more
* xvkbd for laptop branch

and some well-known files

* /var/log/messages (logger should be configureg to not flood it)
* /proc/mounts
* /etc/mtab

Also rfkill pipelet uses hardcoded WIFI_RFKILL_ID value. Change it to one your
wifi card uses (see rfkill list). Well, all pipelets are hackish a bit .

1. git clone git@github.com:ierton/awesomerc-ierton.git

2. mv ~/.config/awesome ~/.config/awesome.old

3. ln -s `pwd`/awesomerc-ierton ~/.config/awesome

PIPELETS
========

This config uses pipelets to post some information into widgets.
pipelet is a program (shell script), which is "conected" 
with widget via pipe. 

All plumbery is hidden in the ./pipeman script. It translates stdout
of its children into awesome calls.

See rc.lua for details and examples.

DEFAULT KEYBINDINGS
===================

Here are some default bindings:

Client keys
-----------

altkey+1 - prev client
altkey+j - prev client
altkey+2 - next client
altkey+k - next client
altkey+tab - toggle last 2 active clients
altkey+3 - begin client manipulation menu (tooltip will appear)

Tag keys
--------

altkey+F1 - jump to one tag left
altkey+F2 - jump to one tag right
modkey+F1 - move focused client one tag left

TODO 
====

*) Add client reordering
*) Implement M$Windows alt+tab functionality (don't know how to 
   capture altkey release event)
*) Add some online translator support
